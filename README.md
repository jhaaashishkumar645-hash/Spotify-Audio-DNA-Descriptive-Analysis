## 📌 Project Overview
In the hyper-competitive streaming era, music curators and labels can no longer rely solely on "gut feeling" to predict success. With thousands of tracks released daily, identifying the specific audio DNA that drives listener engagement is a critical business advantage.

I conducted this analysis to move beyond subjective "vibe" checks. By analyzing the physical attributes of popular music—such as Energy, Acousticness, and Pitch—I’ve defined a "Hit Profile" that helps curators optimize track selection for maximum ROI and listener retention.

## 📂 Business Scenarios Modeled
As a Product or Operations Analyst, descriptive statistics allow us to solve key industry challenges:

* **Establishing Market Benchmarks:** Using central tendency (Mean/Median) to define what a "standard" hit looks like for Energy and Valence.
* **Risk & Consistency Mapping:** Utilizing Standard Deviation to determine if a musical trend is a stable market requirement or a volatile outlier.
* **Technical Optimization:** Applying Pearson Correlation ($r$) to prove how technical mastering (Loudness) directly impacts the perceived "Energy" of a track.

## ⚙️ Methodology & Analytical Process
I followed a structured 3-phase statistical lifecycle to find patterns within a dataset of popular Spotify tracks:

### 📊 Phase 1: Identifying Market Norms (Central Tendency)

* **The Objective:** *What are the "typical" musical characteristics of a hit song, and is there a favorite key?*

* **Analysis Logic:** I used **Histograms** for continuous variables ( Energy, Valence, and Acousticness) and **Column Charts** for discrete categories like Key.
* **Visualizations:**

  <img src="Distribution of Energy.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="Distribution of Acousticness.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="Distribution of Key.png" width="45%" />
</p>

**Central Tendency Analysis:**
| Feature | Mean | Median | Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Valence** | 0.46 | 0.45 | N/A (Continuous) |
| **Energy** | 0.79 | 0.82 | N/A (Continuous) |
| **Acousticness** | 0.15 | 0.04 | N/A (Continuous) |
| **Key** | 5.25 | 5.00 | 1 (C♯/D♭) |

* **Formulas Used:**
   * **Mean:** `AVERAGE()` - To find the average "center" of the music features.
   * **Median:** `MEDIAN()` - To find the middle value and check if the average is being pulled by outliers.
   * **Mode:** `MODE()` - Used for **Key** to find the most frequent pitch used in hits.

* **🔍 Phase-1 Findings:**
The central tendency analysis identifies the core baseline for mainstream success:
    * **Energy Intensity:** Hits cluster heavily around a mean of **0.79**, proving that high-intensity tracks dominate the market.
    * **The "Hit" Key:** By identifying the **Mode**, I found that **Key 1 (C♯/D♭)** is the most frequent choice for top-performing tracks.
    * **Acousticness Bias:** The market shows a massive preference for produced sounds over acoustic ones (Mean score near 0.0).
---

## 📉 Phase 2: Consistency & Variety (Variation & Skewness)
* **The Objective:** *How reliable are these trends? Do hits always have to be "happy"?*

* **Analysis Logic:** I used **Standard Deviation** to measure the risk/variety and **Skewness** to detect if the market leans heavily toward one style.

**Variability & Skewness:**
| Feature | Standard Deviation | Skewness | Market Sentiment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Valence** | 0.2272 | 0.0250 | **Balanced:** No preference for happy vs. sad. |
| **Energy** | 0.1825 | -0.6298 | **Biased:** Strong preference for high energy. |
| **Acousticness**| 0.2400 | 1.4000 | **Rare:** Acoustic hits are very uncommon. |

* **Formulas & Interpretation:**
   *    **Standard Deviation (`STDEV()`)** - Measures the "spread" or consistency:
          * Low SD (< 0.15): High Consistency. The "Standard" for a hit song is very narrow.
          * Moderate SD (0.15 - 0.25): Variable. There is a healthy mix of tracks in this category.
          * High SD (> 0.25): High Variety. No single profile dominates.
   *   **Skewness (`SKEW()`)** - Measures the "lean" or bias:
          * Small (-0.5 to 0.5): Approximately Symmetric. The market is balanced.
          * Moderate (0.5 to 1.0): Moderate Skew. The market shows a clear preference.
          * High (> 1.0): High Skew. The market is heavily biased toward one extreme.

* **🔍 Phase-2 Findings:**
The analysis of variation and skewness reveals three critical market drivers:

   * **Energy is a Non-Negotiable:** With a low spread (**0.18 SD**), high energy isn't just common—it's a requirement. Popularity is tightly clustered around high-intensity tracks, suggesting that low-energy songs face a significant statistical hurdle to become "hits."
     
   * **Mood is a Flexible Variable:** Valence (mood) is almost perfectly symmetrical (**0.025 skew**). This proves that "sad" or "serious" songs have the same market potential as "happy" ones, provided they maintain the necessary production energy.
   
   * **The Produced-Sound Bias:** A high positive skew (**1.40**) for Acousticness confirms the mainstream market is heavily biased toward produced/electronic textures. In the current landscape, acoustic tracks are treated by the algorithm as rare outliers rather than the core "hit" profile.

## 🔗 Phase 3: Feature Synergies (Correlation)
* **The Objective:** *Does volume affect energy? Does track length impact success?*

* **Analysis Logic:** I used Scatter Plots and Pearson’s Correlation ($r$) to identify how audio features move together.

**Correlation Analysis:**
| Feature Pair | Correlation($r$) | Strength | Relationship |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Loudness vs. Energy** |  0.70  | Strong | Positive: Loudness is the primary driver of high-energy perception. |
| **Acousticness vs. Energy**|  -0.61  | Moderate| Negative: Acoustic tracks naturally lose "hit energy" as they become more organic. |
| **Duration vs. Energy** |  0.02  | None | Neutral: Song length has no statistical impact on energy levels. |

* **Formulas & Interpretation:**

* **Correlation (`CORREL()`)** - To determine if two features move together (1.0), move opposite (-1.0), or are unrelated (0).
It measures the strength and direction of a relationship:
   * **Strong (±0.7 to ±1.0):** High Synergy. A change in one feature almost always results in a change in the other.
   * **Moderate (±0.5 to ±0.7):** Consistent Pattern. There is a clear, predictable relationship between these features.
   * **Weak (±0.1 to ±0.5):** Loose Connection. The features are only slightly related.
   * **None (0 to ±0.1):** No Relationship. These features operate completely independently.

* **Correlation Plots:**
<p align="center">
  <img src="Loudness vs Energy.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="Acousticness vs Energy.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="Duration vs Energy.png" width="45%" />
</p>

* **🔍 Phase-3 Findings:**
   * **Loudness is Energy ($r = 0.70$):** High-energy hits almost always require a louder mastering profile. This strong positive correlation suggests that for a track to be perceived as "energetic" by the audience, volume and compression are critical technical requirements.
   * **The "Length Myth" ($r = 0.02$):** Contrary to industry rumors that shorter songs are "punchier," the data shows **no relationship** between song length and energy. Hits can be any duration as long as the internal intensity is right.
   * **The Acoustic Trade-off ($r = -0.61$):** A moderate negative correlation confirms that as a song becomes more acoustic, it systematically loses the "High Energy" signature that currently defines the Spotify charts.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations:
1. **Optimize for "Perceived Intensity":** Prioritize tracks with an **Energy score > 0.70**. Since Energy and Loudness are highly correlated, ensuring a track is mastered competitively is critical for hit potential.
2. **Prioritize Produced Content:** The high positive skew in Acousticness shows that most hits are non-acoustic. Focus curation on produced/electronic textures for mainstream success.
3. **Broaden Emotional Range:** Mood (Valence) is balanced in popular music. Focus on **energy consistency** rather than sticking to just "happy" or "sad" songs.
